Allows admin to act as other users.

== Description ==

The Act As User plugin was born out of a need to view a production site as a specific user (very useful for sites with restricted content). When an administrator is logged in, they will have the option to switch their login id to any user of the site, allowing them to act as that user (in actuality, they have logged out as admin and logged in as that user). They are then able to view the site as that specific user would see it. Act As User allows admins to easily switch back to admin account for site management. Excellent tool for productivity during development, especially on sites with user or role specific content.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `act-as-user` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/`
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
